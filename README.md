# Transpeak Glossary Project
The `glossary.toml` file is using [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) format, further read by Python.

The most important thing to remember is quotes must be escaped like so: `this \"word\" is quoted`

## Adding / Editing Definitions
Anyone is welcome to submit a Pull Request to add or edit a defintiion, provided they fit within the scope of Transpeak.
